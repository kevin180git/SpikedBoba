# Thanks for checking out my website

Sorry it's kind of poopy right now. And empty looking. Trying to get all the required links going so I can ship my app out. The goal is to come back later and make everything prettier. BUT If I don't I'm probably working to make the app better (Hopefully ðŸ˜©). Anyways, thanks for visiting! Shoutout to my fans. And haters, if you hate me enough to come see this that's pretty cool too.

Edit: The app was previously named "Spiked Boba" but Apple deemed it "objectionable" so now it is Drunken Boba. If you see Spiked Boba and you have objections, please send me feedback in the support link below. Thanks!

If you like the app and want to buy me boba or something, my venmo is @KevinLeeHeavenly (don't judge me that was my old rapper name)! THANKS IN ADVANCE ILY. Totally not saying I'll hoe out for boba BUT if you leave a comment/suggestion I'll definitely see ðŸ‘€ it. Future state is also to set up Pateron or something. But we shall see if people even use my app lol. THANKS
